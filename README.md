Maxel is a download accelerator for Mac OS X based off the open source Axel.  It's still very much a work in progress.

#Requirements
I've only tested this on Mac OS 10.6.

#Usage
Enter the url, number of connections, and download destination.  Download.

#TODO: 
Parse output for speed and progress, display a progress bar
Create user preferences to remember preferred download location
Allow for multiple downloads by making the interface a list
Allow for concurrency, multiple NSTasks
Register the file extension .maxel and automatically download the files listed within (plain list or XML with optional checksums)
