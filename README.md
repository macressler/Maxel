# Maxel 2
Maxel will be replaced with Maxel2, a native Cocoa app. It will be distributed on the App Store after an open Beta.

Maxel 2 addresses issues with Maxel 1, such as:

* The ability to pause downloads
* Lower CPU usage
* View multiple downloads
* Better UI
* Smaller binary

# Maxel (unmaintained)
Maxel is a download accelerator for Mac OS X based off the open source Axel.  It's still very much a work in progress.

#Features
Maxel downloads files with many connections, allowing you to saturate your bandwidth. It supports multiple files and will open Metalink 4 files.

#Requirements
I've only tested this on Mac OS 10.6.

#Usage
Enter the urls, number of connections, and download destination.  Download.

#TODO: 
 * Create user preferences to remember preferred download location
 * Make a table cell view and a pause button?
 * Better meta4 integration
